This project is a Vite + React web app for Bitcraft Online crafting planning. Fetch all item, recipe, and resource data from the BitCraft_GameData GitHub repository (https://github.com/BitCraftToolBox/BitCraft_GameData/tree/main/server) using their raw JSON URLs. Only include tiers 1-10 in the UI. Exclude developer tool tiers. Prioritize modular, maintainable code and a modern, user-friendly interface.
